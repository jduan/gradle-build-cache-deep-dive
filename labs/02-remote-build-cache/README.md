Lab 02: Using the remote build cache
====================================

This lab demonstrates using Gradle Enterprise as a remote build cache. A build has been provided that is already configured 
with the remote build cache configuration. The local cache has been disabled for demonstration purposes. You can see the
 configuration in `settings.gradle`.

Steps
-----

1. Change to the directory of lab #2

    ```
    cd 02-remote-build-cache
    ```

2. Run a build. This build will execute without the cache being populated.

   ```
   $ ./gradlew clean check --build-cache
   > Task :clean
   > Task :compileJava
   > Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
   > Task :classes
   > Task :compileTestJava
   > Task :processTestResources NO-SOURCE
   > Task :testClasses
   > Task :test
   > Task :check
   
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
   4 actionable tasks: 4 executed
   ```

3. Run the same build again. This time the remote build cache has been populated from the last run.

   ```
   $ ./gradlew clean check --build-cache
   > Task :clean
   > Task :compileJava FROM-CACHE
   > Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
   > Task :classes UP-TO-DATE
   > Task :compileTestJava FROM-CACHE
   > Task :processTestResources NO-SOURCE
   > Task :testClasses UP-TO-DATE
   > Task :test FROM-CACHE
   > Task :check UP-TO-DATE
   
   
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
   4 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 3 from cache
   ```

4. View the build cache usage summary page to see the global hit rate at https://enterprise-training.gradle.com/cache-admin.

5. Finally, run the same build again, refresh the build cache usage summary page and see how the hits increased.

6. Run the build in step 3 with `--scan` to generate a build scan. Open the build scan URL in the browser and inspect 
aspects like download speeds, unpack times, etc. under `Performance > Task execution`, `Performance > Build cache` and 
`Performance > Settings and suggestions`.
